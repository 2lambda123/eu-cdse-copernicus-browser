**Coverage**: Global coverage with longitude from 180째W to 180째E and latitude from 72째N to 56째S

**Data Availability**: Reference year 2018

**Spatial resolution**: 10 meters.

**Common Usage**: Knowledge of population distribution and density has a number of applications, including disaster risk management or the study and management of urbanisation processes, not only but also in relation to the challenges of climate change and environmental degradation.
